# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# rank = 1
# genre = ['Classic Rock', 'Pop', 'Jazz', 'Blues', 'Rap']
# 100.times do
#     Song.create(
#       title: Faker::Lorem.word,
#       artist: Faker::RockBand.name,
#       rank: rank,
#       genre: genre.sample
#     )
#     rank = rank + 1
#   end
#
#   puts "data has been seeded"
